        <h3 class="section_title">Why CAPS?</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>Cornell Health Counseling & Psychological Services provides professional help for students with mental health concerns right on campus. There is an assessment process before students are assigned a counselor, and then decide if students would like to approach more long-term services. Due to large demand and limited resources, students (under non-emergency circumstances) may have to wait up to a week before they can meet their counselor for the first time. Overall, Cornell CAPS is the most professional and recommended resource for students with mental health concerns on campus, but there are also more accessible and informal programs that students can consider depending on different scenarios.</p>
