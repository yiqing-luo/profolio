        <h3>EARS (Empathy, Assistance and Referral Service)</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>A vibrant peer-led counseling program and training program founded in 1972, EARS continues with the assistance of skilled dedicated volunteers (Cornell Undergraduates, Graduate students and Professional Staff) who have undergone extensive training and have passed through a rigorous selection process to provide non-judgmental, short term counseling. All services are free and confidential. </p>

        <h3 class="section_title">Why EARS</h3>
        <p><em>"I am having some trouble with my roomate. She is my best friend in high school, but some of her habits in the dorm really bother me and I feel like I am always the one making compromises. I don't want to tell my other friends about it, becuase I am afraid they will judge me or don't understand my feelings. This is definitely not something worth visiting a therapist, but I am afraid the discontent will grow in my heart and wreck our friendship."</em></p>
        <p>If you feel that professionals are "intimidating", or get tired of talking to the "grown-ups", or just need someone other than friends and families to listen, EARS is a service you should consider. Some students feel more relaxed at EARS because the peer advisors are Cornell students with similar age and experiences. They are trained to be empathetic, non-judgemental, and help you sort out your thoughts, struggles, emotions, and even secrets. On the other hand, however, student advisors are trained to focus more on listening, reflection and basic problem-solving. Their skills are limited and may be not be sufficient in some situations. But don't worry, the "R" in EARS stands for referral, and it is there to help you learn about more resources and events on campus.</p>
