        <h3>Let's Talk Drop-In Consultation</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>“Let’s Talk” is a drop-in service that offers informal, confidential consultation with a Cornell Health counselor. Counselors hold walk-in hours at various on-campus locations Monday through Friday during the academic year. Stop by any location to speak with a counselor about concerns, get help problem-solving, and learn more about counseling services at Cornell Health and other resources available to you at Cornell.</p>
        <p>Let's Talk consultations are: FREE for Cornell students, offered first-come, first-served <strong>(no appointment necessary)</strong>, confidential, and informal (not intended to be a substitute for traditional counseling)</p>

        <h3 class="section_title">Why Let's Talk?</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p><em>"I just had a bad breakup, and I can't stop thinking about it for days. My mood is really low and I am afraid it will interferne with my studies and other stuff. I don't think I am depressed or anything, I am just having a hard time. It will go away soon."</em></p>
        <p>This would be an example to consider the "Let's Talk" service. For students who have never encountered psychological counseling before, "Let's Talk" is like a gateway, or a try-out to learn what counseling is like. Cornell Health CAPS service does require an assessment session before assigning students to a counselor, so it can be intimidating for students who feel that their problems are not "serious" enough to see a "psych doctor". It is a quick way (no appointments needed) to meet a professional, and students can walk out with a new perception on things, problem-solving skills, or suggestions on whether to use more long-term services.</p>
